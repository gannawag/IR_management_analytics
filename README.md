MBA523 is founded on the premise that all managers in an organization need to be aware
of the role that information technology plays in the success of an enterprise and the
managerial issues that arise in effectively implementing information technology to gain
and maintain competitive advantage. The course provides a framework for understanding
of technical, organizational and strategic issues surrounding the management of
information technologies.

In addition, we live in a data-driven society in which data is being collected and stored at
an unprecedented rate. The future progress of business, economic, social, and technology
advancements depends on those who possess analytical skills. These skills allow one to
use data effectively, to gain valuable insights, and to communicate these insights by
visually depicting critical information and data so an organization can act. It is often said
in business that without data, you are just someone with an opinion.

This course serves as an introduction to the field of business analytics: the skills,
technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative exploration and
investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning.
You will be exposed to the concepts and tools of analytics, including sampling, testing,
confidence, exploration, descriptive statistics, data visualization, predictive analytics,
prescriptive analytics as well as supervised and unsupervised machine learning
techniques. We will apply these concepts to real world case studies and curated data sets.
Various tools will be used including Excel, Tableau/PowerBI, and Python for the tasks in
this course. You should have intermediate Excel skills.
